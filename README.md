# Tata Virtual Job Simulation – Predictive AI in Collections Strategy

This project was completed as part of the **Tata Data Science & AI Virtual Experience Program** on Forage. The simulation focused on applying data science and AI methods to optimize collections strategies at Geldium, a fictional financial services firm.

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a predictive model that identifies high-risk customers likely to become delinquent and to communicate actionable insights through a stakeholder-ready report and a strategic AI implementation deck.

---

## 🔍 Tasks Completed

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored and visualized customer behavioral patterns and financial risk factors.
- Identified strong predictors of delinquency including:
  - High credit utilization
  - Past missed payments
  - Low income-to-debt ratio

### 2. Predictive Modelling
- Built and evaluated a classification model to predict customer delinquency.
- Selected top predictive variables based on feature importance and accuracy.
- Highlighted at-risk segments (e.g., customers with >80% credit utilization and 2+ missed payments).

### 3. Business Report
Created a stakeholder-facing report for Geldium’s Head of Collections including:
- Key predictive insights
- Top 3 risk factors
- SMART business recommendation
- Responsible AI and fairness considerations

### 4. Slide Deck
Designed a 5-slide executive presentation covering:
- How the AI system works (data > decisions > actions > feedback)
- Role of agentic AI (autonomous vs. human oversight)
- Responsible AI guardrails (fairness, explainability)
- Expected business impact (cost savings, improved customer experience)

## ✅ Key Deliverables

- **Predictive Insights Report**: Translates technical findings into business decisions for stakeholders.
- **Presentation Slides**: Strategically outlines system architecture, AI roles, ethics, and impact.
- **Code and Notebooks**: Demonstrates EDA, feature analysis, and predictive modeling.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- AI can significantly improve collections efficiency by identifying delinquency risks early.
- Ethical safeguards (fairness, explainability) are essential to building trust in AI systems.
- Translating data science insights into business value is as important as the model itself.
